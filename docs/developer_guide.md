## 4) Setup and Configuration

**Database Setup:**

1. Create MySQL database named `internhub`
2. Import `db/schema.sql` which includes:
   - Complete table structure
   - Indexes for performance
   - Default user accounts
3. Default accounts:
   - Admin: admin@example.com / admin123
   - Student: student@example.com / student123
   - Company: company@example.com / company123

**Configuration:**

- Edit `includes/config.php`:
  - Set database credentials (DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS)
  - Configure site URL and paths
  - Set timezone (currently Asia/Colombo)

**Apache Setup:**

- DocumentRoot should point to the project root
- Ensure mod_rewrite is enabled
- PHP 8.x+ required

---

## 5) Database Schema

**Core Tables:**

- `user_types`: Role definitions (admin, student, company)
- `users`: Main user accounts with authentication
- `student_profiles`: Extended student information
- `company_profiles`: Company details
- `internships`: Internship postings
- `applications`: Student applications to internships
- `system_logs`: Activity audit trail
- `notifications`: User notifications (planned)

**Key Features:**

- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Performance indexes on lookup columns
- Activity logging for all user actions
- Support for file uploads (resumes, documents)

---

## 6) Security Model

**Authentication:**

- Email/password with `password_hash()` (PASSWORD_DEFAULT)
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based access control

**Authorization Functions:**

- `requireLogin()`: Ensures user is authenticated
- `requireAdmin()`: Restricts access to admin users
- `isLoggedIn()`: Checks authentication status
- `isAdmin()`: Checks admin privileges

**Data Protection:**

- All database queries use prepared statements
- Output escaping via `escape()` function
- Activity logging with `logActivity()`
- Error handling with proper HTTP status codes

---

## 7) Authentication & Authorization

**Login Flow:**

1. User enters credentials on login page
2. System verifies against database
3. Session variables set on success:
   - `$_SESSION['user_id']`
   - `$_SESSION['username']`
   - `$_SESSION['role']`
4. Role-based redirects to appropriate dashboard

**User Roles:**

- **Type ID 1**: Admin - Full system access
- **Type ID 2**: Student - Personal profile and applications
- **Type ID 3**: Company - Post internships and manage applications

**Profile Management:**

- New users redirected to profile completion
- Student profiles include education, skills, contact info
- Resume upload capability (planned)

---

---

## 12) Testing & QA

**Test Structure:**

- `test/` directory with isolated testing
- Separate test database setup
- Login system testing

**Security Testing:**

- SQL injection prevention (all queries use prepared statements)
- XSS protection (all output escaped)
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Role-based access control

**Functional Testing:**

- CRUD operations for all admin modules
- Login/logout flows
- Profile management
- Error handling

---

## 13) API Structure

**AJAX Endpoints:**
All admin CRUD operations use POST requests with JSON responses:

```php
// Standard response format
{
    "success": true|false,
    "message": "Operation result message"
}
```

**Operation Patterns:**

- `add_*`: Create new records
- `edit_*`: Update existing records  
- `delete_*`: Remove records

**Validation:**

- Server-side validation for all inputs
- Duplicate checking for unique fields
- Required field validation

---

## 14) Time-Savers and Tips

**Current Patterns:**

- Consistent CRUD structure across all admin modules
- Reusable AJAX patterns in JavaScript files
- Standard form validation and error handling
- Modular header/footer includes

**Development Workflow:**

1. Database changes → Update schema.sql
2. Backend logic → Add to appropriate task file
3. Frontend → Add corresponding JavaScript file
4. Test → Use admin interface for validation

**Code Standards:**

- Use prepared statements for all database operations
- Escape all output with `escape()` function
- Log important actions with `logActivity()`
- Follow existing naming conventions

**Quick Development:**
- Copy existing admin task structure for new modules
- Use provided AJAX patterns for new features
- Leverage existing CSS classes for consistent styling
- Use header role checking for navigation

**Database Helpers:**
- `getDB()`: Get database connection
- `hashPassword()`: Secure password hashing
- `getUserRole()`: Convert type ID to role name
- `logActivity()`: Record user actions
