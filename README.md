## Setup

### 1. Setup the environment

- **Recomended** - Install XAMPP v8.2.4 (All-in-one utility with all the required dependencies)
    1. Download and install XAMPP from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
    2. Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel

    > [!WARNING]
    > If any other version of PHP, MySQL, or Apache is installed on your machine, please ensure that they are not running to avoid port conflicts.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Using a version of XAMPP other than v8.2.4 may lead to compatibility issues.

### 2. Clone the repository

1. Navigate to the XAMPP installation directory (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs` on Windows or `/opt/lampp/htdocs` on Linux/Mac)
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/xampp/htdocs
    ```
2. Clone or download this repository and place it inside the `htdocs` folder (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\internhub` or `/opt/lampp/htdocs/internhub`)
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dumij58/internhub.git
    ```

### 3. Initialize Database

1. Access phpmyadmin through the browser `localhost/phpmyadmin`

2. Go to "Import" tab and choose the `schema.sql` file from the `db` folder of the cloned repository

    - This creates your database structure and automatically sets up default users with profiles

3. (Optional) FOR TESTING: Seed the database with sample data

    - If you want to test the analytical reports, you can:
        - From the browser, login as admin and navigate to `localhost/internhub/db/seeding/seed-sample-data.php`
    - When you are done testing, you can remove the sample data by navigating to the `localhost/internhub/db/seeding/unseed-sample-data.php`

### 4. Login

1. Open your browser and navigate to;
    - For Admins:
     `http://localhost/internhub/pages/admin/login.php`
    - For Students/Companies:
     `http://localhost/internhub/pages/login.php`

2. Use the default credentials below to log in

    #### Default User Credentials (automatically created)
        - Admin
            - username: admin
            - password: admin

        - Student
            - email: uoc@university.edu
            - password: uoc

    > [!INFO]
    > There is no company account created by default. You can register a new company account through the sign-up page.
    > Or you can use the `seed-sample-data.php` script to seed autogenerated company users and profiles. (refer to [db/seeding/db_seeding_README.md](db/seeding/db_seeding_README.md) for more details)
